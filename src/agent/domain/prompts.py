Synthesize these findings into a root cause conclusion.

Respond in exactly this format:
ROOT_CAUSE:
• <first key finding as a bullet point>
• <second key finding as a bullet point>
• <third key finding - the actual root cause>
• <impact on downstream systems>
CONFIDENCE: <number between 0 and 100>

Keep each bullet point concise (under 80 characters). Use exactly 3-4 bullet points."""
