## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tracer-Cloud/open-sre-agent
cd open-sre-agent
make dev
```

## The Problem

Production data incidents often involve multiple interconnected systems.

Resolving them requires correlating operational signals — logs, metrics, traces, configuration state, and recent changes — across orchestration frameworks, compute engines, and infrastructure.

This investigation process is typically manual and tool-fragmented.

## How Tracer Works

### Investigation Workflow

When an alert fires, Tracer:

1. Ingests the alert from monitoring or incident systems
2. Assembles context from logs, metrics, configs, and dependencies
3. Frames potential failure modes
4. Executes investigation queries across connected systems
5. Evaluates hypotheses based on collected evidence
6. Delivers a root cause report and recommended next actions

---

## Capabilities

- Structured incident investigation
- Parallel hypothesis execution
- Cross-system failure correlation
- Evidence-backed root cause analysis
- Alert triage and MTTR reduction

Designed for production data engineering teams operating complex data platforms.
